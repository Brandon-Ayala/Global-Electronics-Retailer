# Global-Electronics-Retailer

In this project I developed an Executive Revenue Summary for a Global Electronics Retailer, identifying a five-year negative revenue trend during March and April. I delivered clear, story-driven visuals and a PowerPoint presentation with actionable theories and improvement recommendations.

I have videos of me presenting this project available on YouTube. <br>
